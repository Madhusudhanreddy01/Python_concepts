What is unittest in python

unittest is a testing framework in Python that allows you to write and run unit tests for your Python code. 
It is part of the Python standard library, so it is available with every Python installation.

Unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software system 
are tested in isolation to ensure that they function correctly. 
In Python, a unit is typically a single function or method.

unittest provides a set of tools for writing and running unit tests. 
You can define test cases by subclassing the unittest.TestCase class and using its methods to test your code. 
For example, you can use the assertEqual method to test that two values are equal, 
the assertTrue method to test that a Boolean expression is true, and so on.

Here is an example of a simple test case defined using unittest:

css

import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAdd(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

In this example, the TestAdd class inherits from unittest.TestCase and defines a test_add method that tests the add function. 
The if __name__ == '__main__': block at the end of the script runs the test case using the unittest.main() function.

unittest provides many other tools for testing your code, including support for fixtures, test suites, and test runners. 
By writing and running unit tests with unittest, you can ensure that your code works as expected and avoid introducing new bugs when making changes.
